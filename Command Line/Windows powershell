# 📌 1. Introduction to PowerShell

## ✅ What is PowerShell?

* Cross-platform task automation solution by Microsoft
* Includes:

  * Command-line shell
  * Scripting language
  * Configuration management framework
* Built on **.NET Framework**

* Works on **Windows, Linux, macOS**

---

## 🕰️ History

* Early 2000s → Developed by Microsoft engineer Jeffrey Snow
* Released in **2006**
* Designed to replace limitations of cmd.exe & batch scripting
* **PowerShell Core (2016)** → Open-source & cross-platform

---

## ⭐ Why PowerShell is Powerful

👉 Commands return **objects with properties & methods**
➡️ Enables advanced filtering, automation & system interaction
